# 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Mentor Guide - Level 2

## 🎯 Overview

**Audience:** Children aged 10-11  
**Prerequisites:** Level 1 complete or equivalent knowledge  
**Duration:** 10 classes of 1 hour

### Cognitive Characteristics (10-11 years)

- Transition from concrete to abstract thinking
- Greater attention capacity (30-40 minutes)
- Can understand more complex cause-effect relationships
- Better planning capacity
- Can work on multi-session projects

## 🎓 Pedagogical Objectives

### Main Objective

> Develop logical and computational thinking through control structures, repetitions and data manipulation, fostering autonomy and creativity in more complex projects.

### Specific Objectives

**Knowledge:**
- Conditional logic (if/else/case)
- Loops and enumerations
- Basic pattern matching
- Data structures (maps, tuples)
- Functions with multiple clauses

**Skills:**
- Decompose problems into logical steps
- Use control structures appropriately
- Iterate over collections
- Create multi-component programs
- More independent debugging

**Attitudes:**
- Greater autonomy in problem-solving
- Persistence facing more complex challenges
- Pride in more elaborate projects
- Collaboration (if working in groups)

## 📚 Concept Progression

### Differences with Level 1

| Level 1 | Level 2 |
|---------|---------|
| Simple sequences | Conditional logic |
| Basic functions | Functions with pattern matching |
| Simple variables | Data structures |
| Manual repetition | Loops with Enum |
| 1-session projects | Multi-session projects |

## 🗣️ Appropriate Language

### Introduce Technical Terms Gradually

At this age they can handle more technical terminology, but always with explanation:

| Concept | How to Explain |
|---------|----------------|
| Conditional | "If this happens, then do that" |
| Loop | "Repeat something several times automatically" |
| Pattern matching | "Find the pattern that fits" |
| Map | "Like a dictionary: word → definition" |
| Enumerate | "Do something with each element of a list" |

## 🎯 Class Focus

### Class 1: Logic and Decisions

**Objective:** Understand if/else and conditions

**Key points:**
- Analogy with real-life decisions
- True/false conditions
- Multiple options with else/if

**Common challenge:** Confusing `=` (assignment) with `==` (comparison)

### Class 2: Functions with Logic

**Objective:** Basic pattern matching in functions

**Key points:**
- Multiple definitions of a function
- Clause order matters
- Basic guards (when)

**Common challenge:** Not understanding that Elixir tests clauses in order

### Classes 3-10

Detailed planning for each class follows the same structure:
- Clear objectives
- Key concepts
- Practical activities
- Common challenges and solutions

## 🎨 Methodology

### Scaffolding

Provide initial structure and gradually reduce it:

**Weeks 1-3:** Base code provided, they modify  
**Weeks 4-7:** Structure provided, they complete  
**Weeks 8-10:** Only requirements, they create from scratch

### Project-Based Learning

Each concept practiced in meaningful project:
- No isolated exercises
- Motivating contexts (games, music, art)
- Immediate visual results

### Fostering Autonomy

- Guiding questions instead of direct answers
- Time to explore own solutions
- Celebrate different approaches to same problem
- Teach to search in simple documentation

## 🚧 Managing Challenges

### Abstract Concepts

If they struggle with pattern matching or Enum:
1. Return to very concrete examples
2. Draw flow diagrams
3. Use real-world metaphors
4. Additional practice with simple exercises

### Frustration with Complexity

When programs are longer:
1. Teach to divide into parts
2. Test each part separately
3. Comments to remember what each section does
4. Frequent saving of working versions

### Pace Differences

More pronounced at this level:
- **Fast:** Exercism exercises, optional extensions
- **Slow:** More time, additional examples, no pressure
- **Mixed group:** Strategic pair work

## 📊 Evaluation

### Progress Indicators

**Understands conditional logic:**
- Can explain when to use if/else
- Creates correct conditions
- Understands program flow

**Uses repetitions:**
- Identifies when needs a loop
- Uses Enum.each or Enum.map appropriately
- Can iterate over lists

**Solves problems:**
- Decomposes problem into steps
- Tests solutions systematically
- Can debug with minimal help

### Warning Signs

⚠️ **Needs more support:**
- Constant frustration with new concepts
- Doesn't complete basic exercises
- Totally depends on mentor for everything
- Has lost motivation

**Action:** Review if level is appropriate, more transition exercises, 1-on-1 sessions

✅ **Ready for Level 3:**
- Completes exercises easily
- Creates own variations
- Helps classmates
- Asks for more challenges

## 💡 Additional Resources

### For Reinforcing Concepts

**Conditional logic:**
- Decision games (choose your adventure)
- Flow diagrams on paper
- Everyday algorithms with decisions

**Repetitions:**
- Repeated visual patterns
- Musical sequences
- Arrays in real world (shelves, boxes)

### Extra Exercises

**Exercism.org:**
- Lasagna
- Log Level
- Language List
- Boutique Inventory
- High School Sweetheart

## ✅ Mentor Checklist - Level 2

### General Preparation

- [ ] Familiar with Level 2 concepts
