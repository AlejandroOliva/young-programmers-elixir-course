## 💡 Tips for Your Project

### Plan Before Programming

1. **What do you want to create?**
   - Write a simple description

2. **What information do you need from the user?**
   - Make a list of inputs

3. **How will it look?**
   - Draw a sketch on paper (optional)

4. **What colors will you use?**
   - Choose a color palette

### Build Step by Step

* Don't try to do everything at once
* Start simple and keep adding
* Test each part before continuing
* Save frequently!

### If You Get Stuck

* Take a deep breath
* Review previous classes
* Simplify your idea
* Ask your mentor for help
* It's okay not to be perfect!

## 🎨 Help Templates

### Template: Personal Card

```elixir
# Example structure (personalize it)

# 1. Inputs
name_input = Kino.Input.text("What's your name?")
age_input = Kino.Input.number("How old are you?")
color_input = Kino.Input.text("Your favorite color?")

# 2. Show inputs
[name_input, age_input, color_input]
```

```elixir
# 3. Read and display
name = Kino.Input.read(name_input)
age = Kino.Input.read(age_input)
color = Kino.Input.read(color_input)

Kino.Markdown.new("""
<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); 
            padding: 50px; 
            border-radius: 20px; 
            color: white; 
            text-align: center;">

  <hr style="border-color: white; margin: 30px 0;">
  <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;">
    "Hello world! I'm a programmer and I love creating amazing things with code."
  </p>
</div>
""")
```

### Template: Simple Game

```elixir
# Basic game structure
Kino.Markdown.new("# 🎮 MY PERSONAL GAME 🎮")
```

```elixir
# Questions
q1 = Kino.Input.text("Question 1")
q2 = Kino.Input.text("Question 2")
q3 = Kino.Input.number("Question 3")

[q1, q2, q3]
```

```elixir
# Verify answers and show points
a1 = Kino.Input.read(q1)
a2 = Kino.Input.read(q2)
a3 = Kino.Input.read(q3)

points = 0
# Your points logic here

Kino.Markdown.new("""
<div style="background-color: #4caf50; padding: 30px; border-radius: 15px; color: white; text-align: center;">
  <h1>🏆 RESULT 🏆</h1>
  <h2 style="font-size: 60px;">#{points} / 3</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 24px;">Good job!</p>
</div>

* Facilitate, don't direct
* Celebrate each attempt
* Support when they get stuck
* Take photos/screenshots of final projects
* Organize a "presentation" if there's a group
* Celebrate this achievement!

**If there's extra time:**
* Let them improve their projects
* Let them see others' projects
* Let them plan what to do next

**Evaluation:**
* Any project that meets minimum requirements is excellent
* Effort is worth more than perfection
* Creativity is worth as much as technique
