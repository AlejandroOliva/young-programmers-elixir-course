# 🎯 Class 1: Introduction to Programming

```elixir
# Welcome to your first programming class! 🚀
# This is a "comment" - the computer ignores it, it's just for you and me
```

## 🌟 What will you learn today?

Today you're going to discover:

* 🖥️ What programming is
* 📝 How to "talk" with the computer
* ▶️ How to make the computer do things
* 🎉 Your first program!

## 📚 What is programming?

**Programming** is like teaching tricks to your computer. You give it instructions and it follows them.

It's like:

* 📖 Writing a cooking recipe
* 🎮 Programming a robot's movements
* 🎨 Giving instructions to draw

The computer does **exactly** what you tell it, no more, no less!

## 🗣️ Talking with the Computer

To talk with the computer, we use a special language called **Elixir**.

Don't worry, it's easier than it seems!

## 👋 Your First Program: Hello, World!

Ready for your first program? Let's make the computer greet you!

```elixir
# Press the "play" button (▶️) above this code
# Or press Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on Mac)

IO.puts("Hello, world!")
```

### 🎉 You did it!

Did you see the message? You just programmed!

**What do those words mean?**

* `IO.puts` = Tells the computer "show this on the screen"
* `"Hello, world!"` = The message we want to show
* The quotes `"` tell it that it's text

## 🎨 Now you: Change the message

```elixir
# Change the message to something YOU want to say
# Examples: "Hello, I'm [your name]!", "I love programming!", etc.

IO.puts("Hello, I'm a programmer!")
```

### 💡 Experiment

What happens if...?

* You change the words inside the quotes?
* You use emojis? 🎨🚀🌟
* You write in CAPITALS?

TRY IT! The best way to learn is by experimenting.

## 📢 Multiple Messages

Did you know you can show several messages in a row?

```elixir
IO.puts("Hello!")
IO.puts("My name is [your name]")
IO.puts("And I love programming!")
```

### 🎯 Your turn

Change the code above so that:

1. You greet yourself
2. Say your age
3. Say your favorite color

## 🎲 Numbers and Math

The computer also knows math! Let's try:

```elixir
# Addition
IO.puts(5 + 3)
```

```elixir
# Subtraction
IO.puts(10 - 4)
```

```elixir
# Multiplication (uses * instead of ×)
IO.puts(6 * 7)
```

```elixir
# Division (uses / instead of ÷)
IO.puts(20 / 4)
```

### 🧮 Fun math!

```elixir
# The computer can do complicated calculations in an instant
IO.puts(123 + 456)
IO.puts(100 * 8)
IO.puts(1000 / 5)
```

## 🎨 Mixing Text and Numbers

You can combine text and numbers in a special way:

```elixir
age = 9
IO.puts("I am #{age} years old")
```

### 💫 What happened here?

* `age = 9` tells the computer "save the number 9 with the name 'age'"
* `#{age}` tells it "put the number we saved here"

### 🎯 Your turn: Create your presentation

```elixir
# Fill in with your information
my_name = "Your name here"
my_age = 0
favorite_color = "Your color here"

IO.puts("Hello! My name is #{my_name}")
IO.puts("I am #{my_age} years old")
IO.puts("My favorite color is #{favorite_color}")
```

## 🎮 Mini Challenge 1: Personal Calculator

Let's create a mini calculator. You choose the numbers!

```elixir
# Change these numbers to whatever you want
number1 = 5
number2 = 3

IO.puts("My numbers are #{number1} and #{number2}")
IO.puts("Sum: #{number1 + number2}")
IO.puts("Subtraction: #{number1 - number2}")
IO.puts("Multiplication: #{number1 * number2}")
```

### 🌟 Make it yours

* Try with different numbers
* Add your name at the beginning
* Add more operations

## 🏆 Mini Challenge 2: Secret Message

Create a program that shows:

1. A greeting
2. Your name
3. Your age in 5 years (use math)
4. A farewell message

```elixir
# Write your code here




# You can do it!
```

### 💡 Hint

Remember to use:

* `IO.puts("text")` to show text
* `name = "something"` to save information
* `#{name}` to use the saved information
* Operations like `+` `-` `*` `/` for math

## 🎨 Extra Challenge: Be Creative!

If you finished everything and want more, try creating:

**A short poem**

```elixir
IO.puts("Programming is great,")
IO.puts("creating things without debate.")
# Add more lines...
```

**Your daily schedule**

```elixir
IO.puts("At 7 I wake up")
# Continue with your day...
```

**Curious facts about you**

```elixir
name = "Your name"
favorite_animal = "Your animal"
favorite_food = "Your food"

IO.puts("I'm #{name} and I love #{favorite_animal}")
# Add more...
```

## 📝 Today's Summary

Look at everything you learned! 🎉

Today you discovered:

* ✅ What programming is (giving instructions to the computer)
* ✅ How to use `IO.puts()` to show messages
* ✅ That you can use text (between `" "`)
* ✅ That you can use numbers and math
* ✅ How to save information with `name = value`
* ✅ How to combine text and numbers with `#{}`

## 🎯 Extra Practice (at home)

If you want to keep practicing:

1. **Create a longer presentation** about yourself
2. **Make a calculator** that adds your age + a relative's age
3. **Write a message** for someone special
4. **Experiment** by changing everything you can

## 💭 Reflect

Ask yourself:

* What was the most fun part today?
* What was the easiest?
* What would you like to learn next?
* What surprised you?

## 🚀 Next Class

In the next class you'll learn about **Functions** - how to teach the computer new tricks!

It's going to be even more fun. 🎨
