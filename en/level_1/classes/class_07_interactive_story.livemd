## 🎨 Your Turn: Create Your Story

```elixir
# Gather information for your story
character = Kino.Input.text("Hero's name")
place = Kino.Input.text("Where does it happen? (beach, space, forest...)")
magic_object = Kino.Input.text("Magic object")
villain = Kino.Input.text("Villain's name")
```

```elixir
character
place
magic_object
villain
```

```elixir
c = Kino.Input.read(character)
p = Kino.Input.read(place)
o = Kino.Input.read(magic_object)
v = Kino.Input.read(villain)

Kino.Markdown.new("""
<div style="background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 30px; border-radius: 15px; border: 3px solid #4682b4;">

# ✨ The Legend of #{c} ✨

In a place called **#{p}**, lived #{c}, a brave hero.

One day, #{c} discovered **#{o}**, an object with magical powers.

But the evil **#{v}** also wanted #{o}.

#{v} attacked #{p}, but #{c} used #{o} to defend themselves.

After an epic battle, #{c} defeated #{v}.

Peace returned to #{p}, and #{c} was proclaimed a hero.
