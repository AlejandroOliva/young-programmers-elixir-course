## 💡 Tips for Little Programmers

### During Classes

✨ **Read calmly:** There's no rush
✨ **Try everything:** Change numbers, colors, words
✨ **Ask:** If you don't understand something
✨ **Have fun:** That's the main idea!

### If Something Doesn't Work

1. **Read the error message** (sometimes it says what happened)
2. **Check your code** (did you write everything correctly?)
3. **Ask for help** from your mentor
4. **Try again** (don't give up!)

### To Be a Great Programmer

🌟 **Curiosity:** Ask "What if I change this?"
🌟 **Patience:** Errors are normal
🌟 **Practice:** The more you program, the better you'll be
🌟 **Creativity:** There's no single correct way
