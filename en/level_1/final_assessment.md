```

Run and wait for it to finish.

### Step 3: Create your program (30-40 minutes)

Follow these steps, but feel free to change the order or add more!

#### Cell 1: Initial Greeting
```elixir
# Your code here
# Example: IO.puts("Welcome to my world!")
```

#### Cell 2: Ask for information
```elixir
# Create inputs to ask
# Example:
name_input = Kino.Input.text("What's your name?")
# ... more inputs ...
```

#### Cell 3: Show the inputs
```elixir
# Show the inputs so the user can type
name_input
# ... more inputs ...
```

#### Cell 4: Read the answers
```elixir
# Save what the user wrote
name = Kino.Input.read(name_input)
# ... read more answers ...
```

#### Cell 5: Display with colors
```elixir
# Use Kino to show colors
# Example:
Kino.Markdown.new("# Hello #{name}! 🌟") |> Kino.render()
# ... your creativity here ...
```

#### Cell 6: ASCII Drawing
```elixir
# Create your drawing
# Example:
IO.puts("  ^  ")
IO.puts(" /_\\ ")

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

### Strategies:

1. **Take a deep breath** 🧘
   - The best programmers get stuck all the time
   
2. **Read the error message** 👀
   - Sometimes it says exactly what's wrong
   
3. **Look in previous classes** 📚
   - Review notebooks from classes you already did
   - Copy and adapt code that worked
   
4. **Simplify** ✂️
   - If something is too complicated, make it simpler
   - You can add complexity later
   
5. **Ask for help** 🙋
   - Your mentor is there to help you
   - Explaining the problem to someone sometimes solves it

### Where to look for help?

- Notebooks from classes 1-10
- Mentor guide (your mentor has it)
- Ask your mentor
- Search in course examples

---

## 🎁 After Finishing

### Save your work:

1. **Save the notebook:**
   - `Ctrl+S` (or `Cmd+S` on Mac)

2. **Take screenshots:**
   - Of your code
   - Of your program running
   - To remember your achievement

3. **Show it:**
   - To your family
   - To your friends
   - To other course classmates

### Reflect:

**Ask yourself:**
- What was the most fun?
- What was the hardest?
- What am I most proud of?
- What would I add if I had more time?

**Write your answers:**
