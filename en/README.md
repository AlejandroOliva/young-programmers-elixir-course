## 🎯 Welcome

Welcome to the Elixir programming course specially designed for young programmers! This course is designed for children and teenagers between 8 and 16+ years old to discover the fascinating world of programming in a fun, visual, and interactive way.

## 🌟 Why Elixir?

Elixir is a modern, powerful, and elegant programming language that:
- Is **easy to read** and understand
- Allows you to create **robust applications** from the start
