## 🎯 Overview

**Audience:** 16+ years  
**Focus:** Professional web and IoT applications  
**Duration:** 10 classes of 1-2 hours

This level prepares students for junior professional roles.

## 🎓 Pedagogical Objectives

### Main Objective

> Empower to create, deploy and maintain professional web and IoT applications using Elixir's complete ecosystem, preparing them for junior development roles or ambitious personal projects.

### Professional Competencies

**Technical:**
- Complete Phoenix framework
- LiveView for reactive applications
- Ecto for data management
- Nerves for embedded systems
- Production deployment
- Basic CI/CD

**Architectural:**
- MVC patterns
- Separation of concerns
- API design
- Database modeling
- Security basics

**Professional:**
- Code reviews
- Git workflows
- Technical documentation
- Team collaboration
- Project presentation

## 🌐 Phoenix Framework

### Why Phoenix

Phoenix is Elixir's leading web framework:
- High performance
- Real-time capabilities
- LiveView (interactivity without JS)
- Natural scalability
- Used in production by companies

### Progression

**Class 1:** Setup and "Hello World"  
**Class 2:** Routes, controllers, views  
**Class 3:** Basic LiveView  
**Class 4:** Database with Ecto  
**Class 5:** Complete project

## 🤖 Nerves

### Why Nerves

Nerves allows programming hardware with Elixir:
- Professional IoT
- Robust firmware
- Sensor connection
- Motivating physical projects

### Requirements

**Minimum hardware:**
- Raspberry Pi 4 (recommended)
- Or Raspberry Pi 3
- SD card (8GB+)
- Power supply
- (Optional) LEDs, sensors, breadboard

**If no hardware:**
- Focus more on Phoenix
- Nerves conceptual/demo
- Simulators available

## 📊 Evaluation

### Final Portfolio

Final project must be **portfolio-quality**:
- Deployed and accessible code
- Professional documentation
- README with screenshots
- Potentially useful for others

### Competence Indicators

**Phoenix mastery:**
- Creates complete apps independently

## 💪 Message for Mentors

> "Level 5 is the culmination. Your students have come from 'Hello World' to deployed web applications and programmed hardware. Your role now is senior colleague more than teacher. Review code as you would at work. Challenge their architecture. Ask 'why?' Prepare them not just technically, but professionally. You've guided real developers."
