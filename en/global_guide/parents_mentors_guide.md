# 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Guide for Parents and Mentors

## 🎯 Welcome

This guide is designed to help you accompany children and teenagers on their Elixir programming learning journey. You don't need to be expert programmers, you just need curiosity and willingness to learn alongside them!

## 💡 Mentoring Philosophy

### The Role of the Mentor

As a parent or mentor, your role is:

✅ **Facilitator, not teacher**
- Guide without imposing
- Ask instead of answering directly
- Encourage exploration and discovery

✅ **Emotional support**
- Celebrate small achievements
- Normalize errors as part of learning
- Maintain motivation in difficult moments

✅ **Environment organizer**
- Ensure the technical space works
- Manage session time
- Provide additional resources when needed

❌ **What NOT to do:**
- Solve problems for them
- Compare with other children
- Push too hard or make it an obligation
- Minimize their achievements

## 🧠 Pedagogical Principles of the Course

### 1. Constructivist Learning
Children learn best when they **build their own knowledge** through experimentation.

**How to support:**
- Let them try, fail, and try again
- Ask "What do you think will happen if...?"
- Encourage predictions before executing code

### 2. Zone of Proximal Development
Optimal learning occurs when the task is **challenging but achievable**.

**How to identify:**
- If too easy → they're bored, move to next level
- If too difficult → frustration, go back or add more support
- If focused and ask for occasional help → perfect!

### 3. Immediate Feedback
Programming offers instant feedback, take advantage of it.

**How to foster:**
- "What happened? Is it what you expected?"
- "Look at the error message, what do you think it means?"
- Celebrate when code works: "Look what you've achieved!"

### 4. Project-Based Learning
Meaningful projects increase intrinsic motivation.

**How to personalize:**
- Adapt projects to their interests (music, sports, video games, etc.)
- Let them add their own ideas to exercises
- Show their creations to family and friends

## 📅 Session Structure

### Typical Session (1 hour)

**🔷 Start (5-10 minutes)**
- Brief review of previous session
- Presentation of today's objective
- Spark curiosity with a question or demonstration

**🔷 Development (35-40 minutes)**
- Practical work with the day's material
- Guided exploration
- Exercise solving

**🔷 Closure (10-15 minutes)**
- Review of what was learned: "What did we discover today?"
- Celebration of achievements
- Preview of next session

### Session Tips

✅ **Maintain consistent rhythm**
- 1-2 sessions per week is ideal
- Same day and time when possible
- Don't saturate with daily sessions

✅ **Adequate space**
- Quiet place without many distractions
- Good lighting
- Comfortable chair and table

✅ **Active breaks**
- If you see frustration or tiredness, take a break
- 5 minutes rest every 25-30 minutes
- Brief physical exercise helps

   - Make sure it works before the first session
   - Familiarize yourself with the interface

3. **Review the first class**
   - Read the material in advance
   - Identify concepts that may be difficult
   - Prepare additional examples if needed

### During the Course

✅ **Have at hand:**
- [Support resources](support_resources.md)
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)
- Elixir documentation: https://elixir-lang.org

✅ **If something doesn't work:**
1. Don't get frustrated, it's normal
2. Check the troubleshooting guide
3. Error is part of learning
4. Search for the solution together

## 💬 Communication Techniques

### Powerful Questions

Instead of giving answers, use questions:

**🔸 To explore understanding:**
- "What do you think this line of code does?"
- "Why do you think that happened?"
- "Can you explain in your words what we did?"

**🔸 To encourage debugging:**
- "What did you expect to happen?"
- "How is it different from the actual result?"
- "Which part do you think we can change?"

**🔸 To connect knowledge:**
- "Do you remember when we did something similar?"
- "How is this similar to...?"
- "Where else could you use this?"

**🔸 To foster metacognition:**
- "What was the hardest part?"
- "What did you learn today?"
- "What would you do differently next time?"

### Appropriate Vocabulary

**Levels 1-2:** Everyday language
- "Instructions" instead of "functions"
- "List of things" instead of "array"
- "We tell it to do" instead of "we call"

**Levels 3-5:** Introduce technical terms gradually
- Use technical term + explanation
- "Function, that is, a set of instructions that do something specific"
- Gradually reduce explanations as they become familiar

## 🚧 Managing Challenges

### Frustration

**Signs:**
- Negative language: "I can't", "It's too hard"
- Wanting to give up
- Irritability

**Strategies:**
1. Take a break
2. Celebrate what they HAVE achieved
3. Divide the problem into smaller parts
4. Remember previous achievements
5. Switch to something easier and come back later

### Boredom

**Signs:**
- Finishing very quickly
- Frequent distractions
- Lack of enthusiasm

**Strategies:**
1. Add extra challenges
2. Personalize exercises
3. Skip basic exercises
4. Consider advancing levels
5. Propose they teach someone else

### Pace Differences

Every child is different:

**Fast:**
- Offer extensions and challenges
- Exercism.org exercises
- Let them explore on their own

**Slow:**
- More time on each concept
- Repeat exercises with variations
- Celebrate each small step
- Don't compare with others

## 🏆 Celebration and Motivation

### Ways to Celebrate
