# 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Mentor Guide - Level 3

## 🎯 Overview

**Audience:** 12-13 years  
**Prerequisites:** Level 2 complete  
**Particularity:** Transition from Livebook to terminal

### Cognitive Characteristics (12-13 years)

- More developed abstract thinking
- Can handle recursive concepts
- Greater planning capacity
- Can work with professional tools
- Start being interested in "how it really works"

## 🎓 Pedagogical Objectives

### Main Objective

> Develop advanced functional thinking and technical autonomy through recursion, pattern matching and transition to professional development environment.

### Specific Objectives

**Knowledge:**
- Recursion and base cases
- Advanced pattern matching
- Pipe operator `|>`
- Basic processes and concurrency
- Terminal and IEx use
- Code organization in modules

**Skills:**
- Solve problems recursively
- Use terminal confidently
- Create executable programs
- Debug without visual interface
- Read terminal error messages

**Attitudes:**
- Transition from "child who programs" to "young programmer"
- Comfort with professional tools
- Pride in mastering terminal
- Perseverance with abstract concepts

## 🔄 The Terminal Transition

### Why It's Important

Livebook is excellent for learning, but:
- Most real development uses terminal
- Terminal gives more control and power
- Important to know both tools
- Prepares for Level 4 (Mix projects)

### How to Manage the Transition

**Weeks 1-2 (Classes 1-4):**
- Still in Livebook
- More advanced concepts but familiar environment
- Mentally prepare for change

**Week 3 (Class 5):**
- **Key moment:** Terminal introduction
- Make it exciting, not intimidating
- "Now you program like professionals"
- Much accompaniment

**Weeks 4-5 (Classes 6-10):**
- Mixed practice
- Some concepts seen better in Livebook
- Some projects done in terminal
- Gradually more autonomy

## 🔄 Recursion

### Why It's Difficult

Recursion requires non-linear thinking:
- Function calls itself
- Must trust it "eventually ends"
- Base cases not intuitive at first

### Teaching Strategies

**1. Russian Dolls Analogy**
- Each doll contains a smaller one
- Until reaching the smallest (base case)
- Then everything "closes" back up

**2. Visualization**
- Draw the "call stack"
- Show each call with arrows
- See how it "unrolls"

**3. Gradual Examples**
Starting with very simple, progressing to more complex.

## 📊 Evaluation

### Progress Signals

**Understands recursion:**
- Can explain base case
- Identifies when to use recursion
- Can write simple recursive function

**Uses terminal:**
- Navigates directories fearlessly
- Executes code from terminal
- Reads terminal errors

**Pattern matching:**
- Uses in functions
- Understands clause order
- Can match in structures

### Ready for Level 4

- ✅ Masters Level 3 concepts
- ✅ Comfortable with terminal
- ✅ Can create complete programs without Livebook
- ✅ Understands code organization
- ✅ Wants to learn Mix and real projects

## 💡 Additional Resources

### Recursion
- Online recursion visualizers
- Call stack diagrams
- Videos on "how to think recursively"

### Terminal
- Command cheatsheet
- Interactive terminal tutorial
- Practice with terminal games

### Exercism
Recommended exercises:
- Recursion (track)
- List Ops
- Sum of Multiples
- RNA Transcription
- Roman Numerals

## 💪 Message for Mentors

> "Level 3 is transformational. Students go from 'using educational tools' to 'using professional tools'. This transition can be intimidating, but also incredibly empowering. Your role is making them feel like 'real' programmers, because they are. Patience with terminal learning curve, combined with excitement for their progress, makes all the difference."
