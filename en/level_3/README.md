## 🎓 Learning Objectives

By finishing this level:

✅ **Recursion:** You'll understand how functions can call themselves  
✅ **Terminal:** You'll know how to use IEx and run code from console  
✅ **Pattern Matching:** You'll master advanced matching techniques  
✅ **Processes:** You'll understand basic concurrency concepts  
✅ **Autonomy:** You'll be able to program outside of Livebook

---

## 📚 Requirements

**You need:**
- ✅ Level 2 complete
- ✅ Mastery of conditional logic and loops
- ✅ Comfort with functions and lists
- ✅ Abstraction capacity
- ✅ Desire to learn more advanced things

---

## 🔄 Gradual Transition

This level is special because:

**Classes 1-4:** Livebook (as before, but more advanced)  
**Class 5:** Introduction to terminal  
**Classes 6-7:** Mainly terminal  
**Classes 8-9:** Mixed (Livebook to visualize, terminal to execute)  
**Class 10:** Project in your preferred environment

## 💻 New Tools

### IEx (Interactive Elixir)

Elixir's interactive terminal:
```bash
$ iex
iex(1)> IO.puts("Hello from terminal!")
```

### .ex Files

Elixir code in files you execute:
```bash
$ elixir my_program.ex
```
